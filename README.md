# onVoice iOS prototype

Quick proof-of-concept project for adding the Google Speech-to-Text gRPC protobuf files, generating the code classes, and a simple start/stop of audio recording with Flux Notes loaded in a web view.

Heavily derived from the Google sample project: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ios-docs-samples/tree/master/speech/Swift/Speech-gRPC-Streaming

## Getting started

open `FluxNotes.xcworkspace` in xcode to properly load the dependencies for the project.
